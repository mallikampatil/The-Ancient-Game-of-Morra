# The-Ancient-Game-of-Morra
<h2><strong>Description:</strong></h2>

Morra is a hand game that dates back thousands of years. The rules are simple. If a two player game, each player (at the same time) must reveal their hand holding out zero to five fingers; at the same time, they must call out their guess about how many fingers total will be revealed by both players. If a player guesses correctly, they win a point. If both players guess correctly, no points are awarded. If no one guesses correctly, no points are awarded. The total number of points to win is determined before the game starts.

<h2><strong>Implementation Details:</strong></h2>

Created as a player game where each player is a separate client and the game is run by a server. Your server and clients will use the same machine; with the server choosing a port on the local host and clients knowing the local host and port number (just as was demonstrated in class).Project created as a Maven project, GUI developed using JavaFX, and project tested using JUnit testing framework.
